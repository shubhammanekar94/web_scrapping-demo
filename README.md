# Demo for the web scrapping project

## Problem Statement:
Möbelfreude Vertriebs GmbH is a part of the Lumaland family. Their main focus are boxspringbeds. 
They also have their own WEBSHOP www.möbelfreude.de. 

1.	First, you should take a look at all the Boxspringbeds they are currently selling. 
2.	Write a python script that iterates through the webshop and saves the price and other information of each possible boxspring bed. 
(Be aware that our beds come in different sizes.)
3.	Let python write the result to CSV. The end results should look similar to this (no styling necessary): 


LINK	TITLE	SIZE (Größe)	TEMPER (Härtegrad)	Color (Farbe)	Price	Availability
